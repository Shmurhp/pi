      <strong>Important disclaimer</strong>:  The results are not a definitive assessment of your implicit preference. The results may be influenced by variables related to the test (e.g., the category labels or particular items used to represent the categories on the IAT) or the person (e.g., how tired you are).

      <strong>I am aware of the possibility of encountering interpretations of my IAT test performance with which I may not agree. Knowing this, <a href="test.html">I wish to proceed</a>.</strong>
